A collection of scripts I wrote in the past to receive information at publicly accessible endpoints and automate purchases where possible. 
Most are written in Python and have an attributed requirements.txt file.
There is one file written using Javascript requests as well which was written to be ubiquitous for any Shopify site.


These are all likely outdated as sites commonly change their endpoint layout and customer flow.
